# Archived Documentation

This directory contains legacy reference material, troubleshooting notes, and exploratory reports that are no longer part of the day-to-day project workflow. The files are grouped into folders by topic so the historical context is still available without cluttering the project root.

- `admin/` – Past investigations and guides for the legacy admin console implementation.
- `deployment/` – Alternative deployment instructions, reset procedures, and environment setup walkthroughs that have been superseded by the primary deployment docs.
- `research/` – Exploratory write-ups, analysis reports, and archived experiment results.

If you discover that one of these documents becomes relevant again, feel free to move it back to the root documentation area and update it accordingly.
