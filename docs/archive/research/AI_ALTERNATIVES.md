# AI Service Alternatives

FunkMyBrand currently uses **OpenAI API** for core features:

## Current AI Features Using Lovable
1. **Style Analysis** (`generate-style`) - Analyzes uploaded text to extract brand voice
2. **Visual Identity** (`generate-visual`) - Creates color palettes and font recommendations  
3. **Brand Rider Generation** (`generate-brand-rider`) - Assembles brand guidelines
4. **CV Generation** (`generate-cv`) - Creates formatted CVs with different presentation styles

## Why Lovable AI Gateway?
- **Integrated**: Built specifically for Lovable-generated apps
- **Reliable**: Handles rate limiting and error management
- **Cost-effective**: Pay-per-use pricing
- **Multiple Models**: Access to Google Gemini, OpenAI, and others

## Alternative Options

### Option 1: Keep Lovable (Recommended)
**Cost**: ~$5-20/month depending on usage
**Setup**: Get API key from https://lovable.dev/dashboard
**Pros**: 
- Already integrated and tested
- Handles all edge cases
- Multiple AI models available
- Built-in rate limiting

### Option 2: Replace with OpenAI Direct
**Cost**: ~$10-50/month depending on usage
**Setup**: Requires rewriting all 4 Edge Functions
**Pros**: Direct control, potentially lower cost at scale
**Cons**: Need to handle rate limiting, error management, model switching

### Option 3: Replace with Google Gemini Direct  
**Cost**: ~$5-30/month depending on usage
**Setup**: Requires rewriting all 4 Edge Functions
**Pros**: Lower cost, good performance
**Cons**: More complex integration, need error handling

### Option 4: Disable AI Features
**Cost**: $0
**Setup**: Remove AI-dependent features
**Pros**: No AI costs
**Cons**: Removes core value proposition of the app

## Recommendation

**Keep Lovable AI Gateway** because:

1. **Core Functionality**: Your app's main value is AI-powered brand generation
2. **Already Working**: All functions are tested and production-ready
3. **Cost-Effective**: Only pay for what you use
4. **Time Investment**: Replacing would require significant development time

## Getting Your Lovable API Key

1. Go to https://lovable.dev/dashboard
2. Navigate to API Keys section
3. Create a new API key
4. Add credits to your account (start with $10-20)
5. Add the key to your environment variables

## Usage Estimates

Based on typical usage:
- **Style Analysis**: ~$0.01 per analysis
- **Visual Identity**: ~$0.01 per generation  
- **Brand Rider**: ~$0.02 per generation
- **CV Generation**: ~$0.02 per generation

**Monthly estimate**: $5-20 for moderate usage (100-500 generations)

## If You Really Want to Remove AI

To deploy without AI features, you would need to:

1. **Remove Edge Functions**:
   ```bash
   # Delete these functions
   rm -rf supabase/functions/generate-style
   rm -rf supabase/functions/generate-visual
   rm -rf supabase/functions/generate-brand-rider
   rm -rf supabase/functions/generate-cv
   ```

2. **Update Frontend**: Remove AI-dependent components and workflows

3. **Simplify App**: Focus on manual brand creation and CV editing

**Impact**: This would significantly reduce the app's value proposition and user experience.

## Conclusion

The Lovable AI Gateway is integral to your app's core functionality. The cost is reasonable ($5-20/month) for the value it provides. I recommend keeping it and getting an API key to maintain full functionality.
