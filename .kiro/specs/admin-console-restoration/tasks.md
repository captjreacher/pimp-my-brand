# Implementation Plan

- [x] 1. Analyze current admin implementations and identify working components





  - Review existing admin-functions spec requirements and compare with current implementations
  - Catalog all admin page files (WORKING_*, Simple*, Clean*, Debug*, Test*, original pages)
  - Test database connectivity for each admin service and identify which ones successfully connect to Supabase
  - Document working components by testing each admin page and service for real data connectivity
  - Create inventory report of functional vs broken admin implementations
  - Identify successful patterns from real-*-service.ts files and WORKING_* pages
  - Audit codebase for mock data usage and document all instances that need elimination
  - _Requirements: 1.1, 1.2, 1.3, 1.4, 1.5, 2.1, 2.2, 2.3, 2.4, 2.5, 2.6_

- [x] 2. Consolidate working admin components and eliminate broken implementations





  - Extract and preserve working patterns from WORKING_* pages that successfully connect to Supabase
  - Consolidate real-*-service.ts files into unified admin services with consistent Supabase connectivity
  - Remove all duplicate, broken, and mock-data-dependent admin implementations
  - Eliminate all mock data generators, fallbacks, and simulated content from admin services
  - Create unified admin routing configuration based on working navigation patterns
  - Establish consistent admin layout and navigation components from successful implementations
  - Verify complete mock data elimination through comprehensive testing
  - _Requirements: 2.1, 2.2, 2.3, 2.4, 2.5, 3.1, 3.2, 3.3, 3.4, 3.5_

- [x] 3. Assemble unified admin console with full Supabase connectivity















  - Create single admin dashboard entry point integrating all consolidated working components
  - Implement unified admin layout with consistent navigation across all admin sections
  - Ensure exclusive Supabase connectivity throughout admin console with no mock data fallbacks
  - Integrate working user management, content moderation, and subscription management functionality
  - Add comprehensive error handling for database operations and admin actions
  - Implement proper admin authentication and authorization using existing working patterns
  - Test complete admin workflows to ensure reliable functionality and data connectivity
  - Verify elimination of all mock data and confirm real-time Supabase data display
  - _Requirements: 3.1, 3.2, 3.3, 3.4, 3.5, 3.6, 3.7, 3.8, 3.9, 3.10_
