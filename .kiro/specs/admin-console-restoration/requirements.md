# Admin Console Restoration - Requirements Document

## Introduction

The admin console for the Personal Brand Generator has become fragmented through multiple implementation attempts, resulting in scattered mock data, inconsistent database connectivity, and non-functional admin pages. This restoration project will systematically review, clean up, and rebuild a fully functional admin console with reliable Supabase connectivity and no mock data dependencies.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1: Original Design Requirements Analysis

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to understand the original admin console design requirements so that I can restore the intended functionality accurately.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN reviewing existing specifications THEN the system SHALL identify the core admin functions that were originally designed
2. WHEN analyzing the current codebase THEN the system SHALL document which admin features were successfully implemented
3. WHEN comparing implementations THEN the system SHALL identify the most stable and functional admin components
4. WHEN documenting findings THEN the system SHALL create a clear inventory of working vs broken admin functionality
5. WHEN prioritizing features THEN the system SHALL focus on core admin functions: user management, content moderation, and subscription management

### Requirement 2: Codebase Analysis and Working Component Identification

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to identify correctly implemented admin components so that I can preserve functional code and eliminate broken implementations.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN scanning admin pages THEN the system SHALL identify which pages successfully connect to Supabase without mock data
2. WHEN testing database connectivity THEN the system SHALL verify which admin services properly query real data
3. WHEN reviewing component implementations THEN the system SHALL document which admin components are fully functional
4. WHEN analyzing routing THEN the system SHALL identify working admin routes and navigation patterns
5. WHEN evaluating services THEN the system SHALL determine which admin services have reliable Supabase integration
6. WHEN checking authentication THEN the system SHALL verify which admin auth implementations work correctly

### Requirement 3: Clean Admin Console Reconstruction

**User Story:** As an administrator, I want a fully functional admin console with reliable Supabase connectivity so that I can manage the platform effectively without encountering errors or mock data.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN accessing the admin console THEN the system SHALL provide a single, unified admin dashboard without duplicate implementations
2. WHEN loading admin data THEN the system SHALL connect exclusively to Supabase with no mock data fallbacks
3. WHEN navigating admin sections THEN the system SHALL provide consistent routing and layout across all admin pages
4. WHEN performing admin actions THEN the system SHALL execute operations against the real database with proper error handling
5. WHEN viewing admin metrics THEN the system SHALL display real-time data from Supabase without any simulated content
6. WHEN managing users THEN the system SHALL provide full CRUD operations connected to the actual profiles table
7. WHEN moderating content THEN the system SHALL display and manage real user-generated brands and CVs
8. WHEN handling subscriptions THEN the system SHALL integrate with actual Stripe data and subscription records
9. WHEN monitoring system health THEN the system SHALL show genuine analytics and performance metrics
10. WHEN logging admin actions THEN the system SHALL maintain proper audit trails in the database
