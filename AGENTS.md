# How to preview the app for further development

This project is built with Vite, React, and TypeScript. Here are the instructions on how to run the app in different environments.

## Running in Development Mode

To run the app in development mode with hot-reloading, follow these steps:

1.  Install the dependencies:
    ```bash
    npm install
    ```
2.  Start the development server:
    ```bash
    npm run dev
    ```
This will start the app on a local server, typically at `http://localhost:5173`.

## Previewing the Production Build

To preview the production build locally, follow these steps:

1.  Build the app for production:
    ```bash
    npm run build
    ```
2.  Preview the production build:
    ```bash
    npm run preview
    ```
This will serve the built app on a local server, allowing you to test the production version before deploying.
