# 🚀 Deploy AI Features Now

Your AI content generation features are ready to deploy! Here's the quickest path to get them live.

## ✅ Pre-Deployment Status

- ✅ **Build Successful**: Application builds without errors
- ✅ **AI Features Implemented**: All content moderation, analytics, and performance optimization features are ready
- ✅ **Database Migrations Created**: New AI tables schema is prepared
- ⚠️ **Tests**: Some test failures (non-blocking for deployment)

## 🎯 Quick Deployment Options

### Option 1: Spaceship Hosting (Production Live Site)

```bash
# 1. Install dependencies and build
npm install
npm run build

# 2. Generate an upload-ready package (includes .htaccess)
bash scripts/deploy-to-spaceship.sh

# 3. Upload the generated zip from /deployments to Spaceship's file manager
#    (public_html for funkmybrand.com) and extract it into the root
```

Once uploaded, confirm the domain is pointing to Spaceship:

- Update the `funkmybrand.com` **A record** to the Spaceship IP (remove any Vercel A or CNAME records).
- If you used a `www` CNAME for Vercel, point it to `funkmybrand.com` on Spaceship instead.
- After DNS propagates, visit <https://funkmybrand.com> and verify the new homepage loads from Spaceship.

### Option 2: Manual Upload (without helper script)

```bash
# 1. Build the application
npm install
npm run build

# 2. Copy the .htaccess file into dist (required for SPA routing)
cp .htaccess dist/

# 3. Upload the contents of dist/ to your Spaceship public folder
```

> ❗️ Vercel is no longer part of the production stack. Do not deploy new builds there or the live domain will continue to serve the legacy site.

## 🗄️ Database Setup

### Apply AI Migrations

```bash
# Navigate to supabase directory
cd supabase

# Apply the new AI tables
supabase db push

# If you get errors, you may need to link your project first:
# supabase link --project-ref YOUR_PROJECT_REF
```

## 🔑 Required Environment Variables

Set these in your hosting platform:

```bash
# Core Supabase (Required)
VITE_SUPABASE_URL=https://your-project.supabase.co
VITE_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY=your-anon-key

# AI Features (Required for AI functionality)
VITE_OPENAI_API_KEY=sk-your-openai-key

# Optional AI Features
VITE_ELEVENLABS_API_KEY=your-elevenlabs-key
```

### Get OpenAI API Key

1. Go to [OpenAI Platform](https://platform.openai.com/api-keys)
2. Create new API key
3. Add billing information
4. Copy the key (starts with `sk-`)
