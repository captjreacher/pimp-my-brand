```bash
# 1. Install Vercel CLI
npm i -g vercel

# 2. Deploy
vercel --prod

# 3. Set environment variables in Vercel dashboard:
# - VITE_SUPABASE_URL
# - VITE_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY  
# - VITE_OPENAI_API_KEY (required for AI features)
# - VITE_ELEVENLABS_API_KEY (optional)
```

```

## 🗄️ Database Setup

### Apply AI Migrations

```bash
# Navigate to supabase directory
cd supabase

supabase db push

# If you get errors, you may need to link your project first:
# supabase link --project-ref YOUR_PROJECT_REF
```
